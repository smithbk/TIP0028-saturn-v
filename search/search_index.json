A ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP) is a deliverable of the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group . Audience \u00b6 ToIP Layer 4 Ecosystem Projects that follow the guidance of the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group will make decisions during the DEFINE and CREATE workflow swimlanes that will allow them to articulate specific technology requirements. They can use these requirements to help in their selection of which ToIP TIP they seek to leverage. Figure 1: ToIP EFWG Workflow Swimlanes As stakeholders in a specific Ecosystem Project consider the various technology ingredients associates with a solution architecture, they may appreciate the guidance of ToIP TIPs that have formulated a very specific solution recipe containing a profile of use cases backed by technology that has been implemented and tested by a community of vendors. The Saturn-V TIP represents one such solution recipe. Name \u00b6 This TIP represents the next evolutionary step towards the moon shot known as decentralized identity. Acknowledging the recently successful NASA/Space-X mission that has revitalized attention to space exploration, history reveals that our early success in space was significantly aided by the Saturn V multi-stage rocket platform. The Saturn V three-stage rocket served as a Heavy Lift Vehicle for space exploration. It was the most powerful rocket that had ever flown successfully. The Saturn V was used in the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also was used to launch the Skylab space station. Containing three (3) powerful fuel-stages, this massive rocket was used to propel man to the moon. Since we are in the early stages of the technology adoption lifecycle for decentralized identity, we seek a technical architecture (recipe) to bootstrap an interoperable digital trust marketplace. Analogous to the first three layers of the ToIP Technology Stack, this TIP represents an exemplar of a technical collaboration to help propel decentralized identity into mainstream adoption. In fact the Saturn V project required that three separate companies, each responsible for a separate fuel-stage, collaborated to integrate their fuel-engines into a single interoperable rocket platform that would propel the Appolo and Skylab missions. Today, we seek to integrate technology for three ToIP Layers to achieve a common goal -- help propel the adoption of digital credentials . Purpose \u00b6 Today, the decentralized identity community continues the moon shot started by the Sovrin Foundation towards self-sovereign identity. This proposal is unique as it represents a vertical interoperable stack that is already familiar to most industry participants. This proposal is effectively receiving the baton that began with the Sovrin Network and will focus on evolving that effort into a network of networks model.

We need to describe an example TIP that is of interest to many in the ToIP Foundation. As the Sovrin Community transitions under the broader umbrella of the ToIP Foundation, we need a description of the architecture in which the community desires to embrace. We need a methodology that will allow alternative TIPs to be compared to the one most familiar with many in the ToIP Foundation. We need a forum for the Indy Interop-athon events that are focused on making the network of networks concepts reality of public identity utilities based on Hyperledger Indy.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#saturn-v-tip","text":"The Saturn-V TIP is a recommendation of the ToIP Foundation.

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) \u00b6 This TIP is purpose built to provide the foundational infrastructure necessary to support the 10 Core Principles that were adopted by the Sovrin Foundation in support of SSI. Principle Description Existence Users must have an independent existence. Control Users must control their identities. Access Users must have access to their own data. Transparency Systems and algorithms must be transparent. Persistence Identities must be long-lived. Portability Information and services about identity must be transportable. Interoperability Identities should be as widely usable as possible. Consent Users must agree to the use of their identity. Minimization Disclosure of claims must be minimized. Protection The rights of users must be protected. Decentralization by Design \u00b6 The ToIP Design Principle Recommendation - DP0005: Decentralization by Design provides a spectrum of considerations to be considered when solution architectures are contemplating the degree of decentralization that is required. This TIP minimally specifies that the root of trust MUST be managed in a decentralized manner, preferably by one or more decentralized public identity utilities.
